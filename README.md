# Caiquenator

On a fateful day, looking for developers to review your PR, our hero
@caiquemitsuoka created a way to engage more people to do that for us.
And we, recognizing a good idea and thinking about all the other developers who
certainly have the same difficulty, decided to create Caiquenator! ðŸŽ†
